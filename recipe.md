DIRECTIONS:

Step 1: Place frozen berries, brown sugar and vanilla extract in a saucepan over medium-low heat. Cook for 8-10 minutes or until the berry mixture is thick and 'jammy'. Remove from the heat and set aside to cool.

Step 2: Heat croissants in a warm oven or microwave. If using frozen croissants, prepare following packet instructions.

Step 3: To serve, place croissants on a serving platter and serve with the berry compote.
